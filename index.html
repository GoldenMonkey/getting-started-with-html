<H1>The Basics</H1><body>
<b>The Web</b>
<p>The World Wide Web was invented in the early 1990's.  The main type of document on the web is HTML and HTML is connected by hyperlinks.
<b>HTML</b>
<p><em>HTML</em> stands for Hyper TextMarkup language.  It forms the heart of the web and is made up of text content and markup lanuage, references to other documents, and links to other pages.</p>
<p><em>Markup</em> comsists of <em>tags</em> and <em>elements</em>. <em>Tags</em> are always contained in brackets and musy have opening and closing tags unless they are void.</p>
<b>HTML Attributes</b><p>Some tags contain attributes which assign a value that is applied to the element.  An example would be the <em>anchor</em> tag which can be used to link to other pages <a href="www.udacity.com">like this</a>.</p>
<b>Inline and Block Elements</b><p>Block elements differ from inline elements in that they form a box around their content.</p>
<b>Computers are stupid</b>
<p>Computer are considered stupid by programmers because they can only interpret <em>exactly</em> what is written by programmers, and not what a programmer may have <em>intended</em> to write.</p>

<b>Programmers cant remember everything</b>
<p>Finally it is good to remember that due to the large amount of content involved inprogramming programmers can't remember everything.  When the time commes and you are in a bind, don't be afraid to look it up.</p>
